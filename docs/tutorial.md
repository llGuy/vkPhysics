## Menus

In the main menu, there is a panel on the right with 4 buttons - respectively, "Search for servers", "Build maps", "Settings" and "Quit".

Press the top button to open the servers menu which will show the servers which are currently online.

Select on from the servers list (in the case of the picture, click on "Official"), then press the connect button.

Once you arrive in the server menu, there will once again be 4 buttons on the right, but they are now, respectively: "Spawn", "Select team", "Settings", "Disconnect".

Spawn is grayed out as you need to select a team - click on the teams icon to open the teams menu.

Select your team by clicking on the color of the team. Once the team was selected, press the spawn button which will no longer be grayed out.

If at any point you die, just press the spawn button again.

## Gameplay

In this multiplayer game, you can be in one of _two_ different forms (or modes): the first is _rolling_ mode and the second is _standing_ mode. To change modes, simply press the `E` key (you can press it however many times, and as quickly as you want to toggle between the two modes).

### Rolling mode

In rolling mode, the camera moves to third person and you take on the form of a ball. In this mode, all you can do is move around with `WASD`. However, when moving in rolling mode, the gravity you're affected by, will change depending on the surface you are rolling on. More specifically, the vector which will pull you down, will constantly change to the the opposite of the normal of the surface you are on. You will notice the gravity changing, as the your camera's roll/pitch/yaw slowly change to match the current gravity vector as seen in this image:

This will strategically make rolling mode the preferred mode for moving around as you will easily be able to climb up sharp slopes. The issue, is however, that you cannot use any of your powers, which you need in order to fend off enemy players. To get access to your powers, you will need to change to standing mode.

#### Quick note on spawning

When you spawn, you will by default be in rolling mode, however, you will spawn very far away from any structures (terrain). You kind of start off as a flying ball, and you can adjust the direction you're flying towards by moving your mouse accordingly. You will of course slowly accelerate.

You will note however that it does take a little time to get to any form of terrain. This is done on purpose to avoid instantly respawning (maybe in the future, there will be designated spawning points which won't be terraformable).

### Standing mode

In standing mode, the camera moves to first person and you take on the form of a humanoid. In this mode, you can once again move with `WASD`, but gravity will not change - it will stick to the last gravity that you were affected by when in rolling mode. This makes it less optimal for moving around freely.

However, you do have access to your powers (or weapons).

At the current stage of the game, there are 2 weapons - and toggling between them can be done by pressing `Q`.

The first power/weapon, is your ability to throw rocks at your enemies. This will deal 75 damage (all players start off with 200 health, so getting hit by a rock results in losing 75 health points, displayed at the bottom left corner).

The other power/weapon, is your ability to terraform.

With this ability, you will be able to build bridges/structures which will help you strategically.

### Note:

Falling into the void will result in dying.
