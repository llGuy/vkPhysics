## Game servers

### Running servers locally

To run a server locally, simply run the `vkPhysics_server` program and enter a name for the server when prompted.

Unless you have portforwarded (TODO: include info on the ports to portforward to), you won't be able to click on the server name (from the server list in the main menu). You will need to manually input `127.0.0.1` into the typing box on the bottom left the server browsing menu as seen below:
